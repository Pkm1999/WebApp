    <a id="stack">Stack</a>
    <h3>Stack</h3>
    <p>
        Stack is a <mark style="color:green">linear data structure</mark> that follows a particular<br />
        order in which the operations are performed.<br />
        The order may be<u> LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)</u>.<br />
        Stack provides <b>Push()</b> for insertion and <b>Pop()</b> for deletion<br />
        in stack.

    <h3>Queue</h3>
    <p>
        A Queue is a <mark style="color:green">linear data structure</mark> which follows a particular order<br />
        in which the operations are performed. The order is<u> First In First Out (FIFO)</u>.<br />
        A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource<br />
        where the consumer that came first is served first.<br />
        Queue provides <b>Enqueue()</b> for insertion and <b>dequeue()</b> for deletion<br />
        in stack.

        A linked list is a <mark style="color:green">linear data structure</mark> in which<br />
        the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.<br />
        In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where <br />
        each node contains a data field and a reference(link)<br />
        to the next node in the list.
